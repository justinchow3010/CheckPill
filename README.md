# :wave: Background  
This project focuses on general public health and especially for the older generation as we notice that the needs for healthcare and medication for the elderly are upsurging. Moreover, it is common that patients sometimes will take the wrong medicines or the wrong number of medicines, which could cause them unprecedented and irreversible harm. While such a situation is more associated with the elderly. In light of this, through this project, my partner and I would like to develop an application to avoid patients from taking the wrong pills and mitigate the bad consequences.  

# :mag_right: Detection Process
